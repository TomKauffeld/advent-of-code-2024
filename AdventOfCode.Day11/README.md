# [Advent of Code 2024](../README.md) - [Day 11: Plutonian Pebbles](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/11)

## Part 1
The first way was to just brute force it by following the rules 25 times.  
Then counting the amount of items in the list at the end to find the awnser.  

## Part 2
For this part I've started using bruteforce. However the application was at more than 10GB of memory use
and started to take a minute to find the next item at only index 40. So this has been stopped in order to find 
(but not yet found) a more eloquent solution.
