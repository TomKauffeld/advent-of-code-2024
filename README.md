# [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)
My Solutions to the advent of code 2024.  

## Previous Years:
* [2023](https://github.com/TomKauffeld/advent-of-code-2023)

## Q/A:
* **Why C# ?**  
  Almost the same reason as using PHP last year, instead having the extra flexibility of using multithreading if required.
* **The code doesn't look optimized and/or maintainable.**  
  True, however that wasn't the goal: These scripts are made to solve one and only one issue as fast as possible. And so the time spent on making clean code is used instead on solving the puzzle.
* **Are you on the leaderboard?**  
  Nope. But my goal is primarily to use the puzzles as logic training. I do try to solve them on the same day as they come out, but will start at the end of the workday.
* **Can I copy your solutions?**  
  I would say **NO**: the challenge is to try the puzzles for yourself. However, the code is available, and I can't stop you.
* **Can't someone use your solutions to get on the leaderboard?**  
  They can't, the leaderboard is already full before I've even seen the question.
* **Where can I try the puzzles?**  
  You can go to the [website](https://adventofcode.com/2024]).
* **How do you handle the data?**  
  As it isn't allowed to upload the input files, they are in another private repo using git submodules to have them available.
